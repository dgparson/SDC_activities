# Use Case Summary:

**Topology=SDCv2-SNE-10G-Impairments-MX-10G, Automation=TBD**

**Type:** L2-3 Untagged,  Traffic Benchmark and DUT Performance

**Description:** The traffic pattern between devices is a typical pair pattern with a total of IPs that a given subnet allows, times 2 since traffic is bi-directional. The MAC addresses are randomly generated. The test settings are default and compliant with RFC-2544 RFC.

#

**Methodology:** The Spirent RFC-2544 automatic baseline verification will measure upper limits of the target SD-WAN circuit by establishing peek bandwidth, latency, jitter and loss tolerances. Spirent uniquely test this standard by implementing a single pass for all core metrics methodology. This saves time and allows the user to corelated key KPI metrics such as the relationship between loss and increasing average latency. Further, Spirent will use our exclusive *Turbo Iteration* features to efficiently cycle though desired frame size and load parameters.
